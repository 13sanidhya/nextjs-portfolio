        Passionate engineering student now in his final year, specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I love confronting real-life challenges with out-of-the-box thinking and technical know-how. Combining the creativity and inquisitiveness for good, I do everything from working on intelligent systems and performing deep learning studies to data analysis and really putting solutions on the ground. I am keen on acquiring more knowledge, advancing my career, and having my share in breakthrough technology with far-reaching implications.
